# üîê Admin Access Guide

## How It Works
The admin panel is now hidden from public view, just like the original De Globe Caf√© website. No admin buttons or links appear on the main site.

## Admin Login

### Getting to Admin
- **URL**: Type `/admin/login` in your browser
- **Login**: 
  - Email: `admin@deglobecafe.com`
  - Password: `admin123`

### What Changed
We removed all the admin buttons that were showing on the main website:
1. **Header** - Replaced admin button with "Book a Table"
2. **Mobile menu** - Replaced admin link with "Book a Table"  
3. **Footer** - Removed admin section, added "Services" instead
4. **Floating button** - Completely removed

### Customer Experience
Now customers see:
- Clean navigation (Home, Menu, Gallery, Our Story, Blog, Contact)
- "Book a Table" button instead of admin links
- Professional footer with services (Order Online, Private Events, etc.)
- No admin clutter anywhere

### For Admins
- Type `/admin/login` manually in browser
- Login with credentials above
- Access full dashboard as before
- All admin features still work perfectly

## Technical Notes
- Added CSS to hide any leftover admin links
- Admin routes still exist but are hidden
- Customer interface is now clean and professional

**The website now matches the original site's clean design with no visible admin elements.**
